    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony (Warm Neutrals) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive dashboard to simplify the school selection process. The structure consists of a main header, a filtering control panel, and a two-column content area. The left column features a dynamic bar chart for quick visual comparison of school ratings, while the right column displays detailed school information in a filterable card-based list. This dashboard approach was chosen because it allows users to see both a high-level overview (the chart) and detailed information (the cards) simultaneously. The core interactions—filtering by curriculum and distance—dynamically update both the chart and the card list, providing immediate feedback and facilitating a seamless, user-driven exploration. This is more effective than a static list as it empowers the user to narrow down options based on their specific criteria (e.g., 'Only show me CBSE schools within 5km'). The user flow is simple: view all options, apply filters to refine the list, and review the details of relevant schools. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. School Ratings Comparison: Report Info: School names and their parent ratings. -> Goal: Compare -> Viz/Presentation Method: Horizontal Bar Chart. -> Interaction: The chart is dynamically updated based on the active filters for curriculum and distance. Hovering over a bar reveals the exact rating in a tooltip. -> Justification: A horizontal bar chart is excellent for comparing ranked values across categories with potentially long labels (school names). It provides a quick, intuitive visual answer to "which schools are best rated?". -> Library/Method: Chart.js/Canvas.
        2. Detailed School Information: Report Info: Comprehensive details for each school (address, curriculum, distance, highlights, and new details like contact info, philosophy, facilities, etc.). -> Goal: Organize & Inform -> Viz/Presentation Method: A responsive grid of content cards. Each card contains all information for one school, with additional details revealed via an accordion (details/summary tag). -> Interaction: The visibility of cards is controlled by the curriculum and distance filter buttons. Clicking the summary reveals/hides more details. -> Justification: Cards are a modern, scannable, and mobile-friendly way to present distinct chunks of information. The accordion keeps the initial view clean while allowing users to drill down for more specific information without leaving the page. -> Library/Method: HTML/Tailwind CSS + Vanilla JS for filtering and accordion functionality.
        3. Filtering Controls: Report Info: School attributes like curriculum and distance. -> Goal: Compare & Organize -> Viz/Presentation Method: A set of interactive buttons grouped by category (Curriculum, Distance). -> Interaction: Clicking a button filters the dataset. An 'active' state visually indicates the current filter. -> Justification: Buttons are a universally understood UI element for triggering actions. Grouping them makes the filtering options clear and easy to use. -> Library/Method: HTML/Tailwind CSS + Vanilla JS.
